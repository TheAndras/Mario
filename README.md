I created this little game for my JAVA course exam a year ago. 
This game inspired by Super Mario and Cat Mario.

The game contains a lot of trap and wild creatures, this makes the game difficult but It's possible to done after a few try
You can collect coin like the original Super Mario.
Your life can go below zero like Cat Mario.

You can play this game by W,A,S,D and arrows too.
If you're trapped you can press ESC, you will lose a life and you can try it again.
You can kill mushrooms if you jump on them.
